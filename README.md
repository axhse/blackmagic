### About
**BlackMagic** is a functional language developed specially for a secret big international IT company for unknown reasons.  
It has dynamic typing (definitely inspired by Python v2ðŸ’™ and JSðŸ’œ).  
It may be interpreted with the developed F# interpreter.  
The results of parsing and execution print to the console.  
**BlackMagic** is an extremely pure language; so far it has no even IO functions (though they may be easily implemented via some simple F# functions).  
Thus, the result of code execution is handled directly by interpreter.  
 **BlackMagic** may not exist actually beside F# infrastructure, but at the same time, it may be quite easily integrated into other F# code.  
 ### Quick Start
 Clone the project and open ***/interpreter*** folder as F# project (VS is recommended).  
 If the working directory is properly configured, then the std and factorial program sources will be loaded and then interpreted. You will see the result and the colored syntax on the console output.  
 ### Syntax
 The language has no keywords, but use a few special symbols.  
 There some built-in types and functions supported.  
 Each program should be a group of function declarations (though zero-parameter functions actually behave like global variables).  
 Some syntax features are specified in [BUILTIN.md](https://github.com/MAILabs-Edu-2023/fp-compiler-lab-axhse/blob/main/docs/BUILTIN.md).  
 ### Features
- [x] The language has variables that may be declared inside the body of any function. However, no keyword is used for specifying any declaration, even a function declaration, though some special symbols are used for this.
- [x] The language supports recursion.
- [ ] Lazy evaluation is not supported, so the `ifElse` function always calculates all it's arguments. In this case, it's recommended to pass partially applicated functions as `onTrue` and `onFalse` parameters.
- [x] Functions are supported.
- [ ] Closures are not supported.
- [ ] IO is not supported (but may be easily added to the std function set if it will be necessary) - right now F# tools are used to load input data and print the result.
- [x] Arrays are supported (may store any values at the same time) with the minimal set of functions that are enough to implement other common sequence functions.
- Some highly required functions for integers, arrays, strings, and others are implemented by F# natively. Other functions may be specified based on them (as **std**, for example).

### Interpreter
There are several steps from accepting text code to executing the program:
1. The interpreter accepts raw text code (that may be specified manually or loaded from any file).  
Additionally, the user should specify which function to run and with what arguments.  
2. Initially, the parser splits the text into tokensâ€”special symbols, words, and others.  
3. Then, tokens are parsed into syntax, maintaining the text structure but with much more information about text elements.  
4. Following this, syntax is compiled into expressions and the original file structure now lost here, but now it's much easier for us to understand how to execute the code.  
5. Finally, the compiled code is executed. There are some runtime errors that may occur:
- Impossible application: There is a logic error with function application, so at some point, we get a singular value that cannot be applied further.
- Invocation depth limit: The depth of the function invocation stack is too high to be safely processed.
- Start error: We try to execute an unknown function or pass too many arguments.

Some basic "built-in" functions are implemented directly by F#. The set of these functions is designed to be the smallest possible, enough for implementing other popular functions.  
The language has its own typing system, although it may be quite easily converted back and forth to the F# type system.
